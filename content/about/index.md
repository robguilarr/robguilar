#### :(fas fa-hiking fa-fw): Personal life & Hobbies

I’m a person who loves to read about issues related to the gaming industry, especially in companies such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Bethesda, Xbox Studios, Supercell, among others; also in matters of marketing and applicability of Data Analysis in development, design, research and postproduction -- That's why two of my main appeals are **Applied Data Science** and **Game Development**.

Among other personal hobbies, I like playing video games and practicing outdoor sports like trail running. And a fun fact —  I live with a golden Holland Lop named Jacka.
