#### :(far fa-compass fa-fw): About my career

<div>

A few years ago, I started studying Industrial Engineering, at the same time, as a hobby, I started learning how to develop mobile games in Unity. Since video games have always been one of my favorite hobbies, I enjoyed learning how to make them and still. Unfortunately, after a year and a half, I put it aside.

Shortly after, a friend told me about Data Science — but at first, it didn't interest me because I didn't have a precise idea of ​​what it was about.

However, one of my favorite topics has always been statistics and probability — and then discovered that some people in the Software Entertainment industry are dedicated to retaining and acquiring users via analytics and data mining techniques to improve the UX and make games sustainable. And most of those people had backgrounds associated with Analytics careers like Data Science and Engineering — which is why I started to get inspired to follow this path.

#### :(fas fa-hand-holding-medical fa-fw): What can I offer

I'm a data analyst with engineering skills made by a self-learning attitude. With experience in consulting, consumer goods, and virtualization technology industries. Who as an add-on has great enthusiasm for the Software Entertainment industry, in how data analytics can improve it as a business, using pre-development analytics, live metrics, and acquisition/retention analysis; for indie markets and big publishers.

Although I don't consider myself an expert, I do have a curious and creative mind. As the renowned author Austin Kleon once said, "You don't have to be a genius... Sometimes amateurs have more to teach us than experts." I'm always eager to learn and explore new ideas without placing contraints. That's why I enjoy sharing my work and getting feedback from like-minded people. So, if you share the same interests as me, I would be thrilled to help you out in any way I can.

Before I started working as a data analyst, I started out as a self-taught Unity programmer. This describes a very important characteristic of mine, and it is the motivation to continuously learn on my own, in the sense of wanting to explore the unknown and accept new challenges. I like to propose **creative perspectives** to improve in each area of work, especially when it comes to getting the most out of one of today's most valuable resources, data.

#### :(fas fa-hiking fa-fw): Personal life & Hobbies

I’m a person who loves to read about issues related to the gaming industry, especially in companies such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Bethesda, Xbox Studios, Supercell, among others; also in matters of marketing and applicability of Data Analysis in development, design, research and postproduction -- That's why two of my main appeals are **Applied Data Science** and **Game Development**.

Without going too deep, I'm fascinated by following news from high-tech companies (such as Google or Microsoft) about new product releases and market movements. Also like to read books about Business, Productivity, Personal Growth and Video Games. Referring to authors such as Tom Rath, Austin Kleon, James Clear and David Goggins.

Among other personal hobbies, I like playing video games and practicing outdoor sports like trail running. And a fun fact —  I live with a golden Holland Lop named Jacka.
