#### :(far fa-compass fa-fw): About me

As a Data Scientist within Growth, Marketing and Sales, I've made a significant impact across various commercial sectors, including tech, consumer goods, and retail. Working closely with clients to deliver production-level assets based on advanced analytics algorithms, deep learning, and GenAI RAG systems for scalable E2E solutions.

I've a lifelong interest in combining gaming growth and AI solutions for digital platforms, with a particular focus on free-to-play mobile gaming and the metaverse.

At 15, I taught myself game development in Unity, sparking a journey that evolved from software engineering to deep interests in statistics, algebra, calculus and AI/ML. Early on, I developed solutions to enhance mobile game monetization and retention.

#### :(fas fa-hiking fa-fw): Personal life & Hobbies

I’m a person who loves to read about issues related to the gaming industry, especially in companies such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Bethesda, Xbox Studios, Supercell, among others; also in matters of marketing and applicability of Data Analysis in development, design, research and postproduction -- That's why two of my main appeals are **Applied Data Science** and **Game Development**.

Among other personal hobbies, I like playing video games and practicing outdoor sports like trail running. And a fun fact —  I live with a golden Holland Lop named Jacka.
