Among my hobbies, one that catches my curiosity the most is design and graphics. Despite not being a professional designer, I like to try new things in Adobe Illustrator, especially related to my interests.

For this reason, in my free time, I sometimes like to try to design, create or replicate infographic designs that I like, which as a hobby I will be posting on Pinterest.

In case you are interested, I invite you to my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/robguilarr">Pinterest</a> profile.
