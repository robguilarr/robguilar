In the next portal, you will find a frame with a diagram. This one displays the distinct roles and sub-roles in a video game development team.

This section intends that as you read the **Stakeholders** section in each of my projects, you can learn about the operations, roles, and skills that each team member must possess. For this, you can read the details at the bottom of each card made for each.

Important: not all of them are a necessity for development, depending on the scale of the project some are required and others are not. Also, within different branches, you will find positions that may only be necessary for mobile game development, in addition to PR and marketing roles.
