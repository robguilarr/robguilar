Today I decided to start a new journey in <b>Medium</b>.

{{< image src="/images/posts/Medium.jpeg" width="100%" height= "100%" alt="Medium_Logo">}}

Perhaps you have noticed in my about section that I have always been interested in documenting my work and write about it, or as Austin Kleon would have said, this is a "Daily Dispatch" where I will show pieces of work, or at least i will try to :thinking:

However, I will use this platform to keep track of the progress of my recent projects in <b>Data Science</b> and some <b>Analytical stuff</b>, in a not exactly final-product way, but like a notebook.

Just to put you in context, I'll use Medium as side documentation for Data Science Projects, so on this Website, I will post the project until it reaches the final stage. Thus for this moment, my main focus is to <b>show my work</b> and <b>share results</b>.

Furthermore, if I have enough time I will write some other posts about other kinds of topics, like Books, Productive Working techniques, and some about Entertainment or personal interests like Video Games. Because I think that more important than just focusing on one niche, it's important to have your essence of what you are deeply interested in.

> As one of my favorite writers <a href="https://perell.com/">David Perell</a> mentions on his course "Write of Passage", as we want to show our work we need to define our Personal Monopoly, that skills and areas that are so specific that we can use together to leave our footprint (quick overview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08S67KEb6hQ">here</a> at minute 45), although my main focus is not being a writer, an aspiring Data Scientist needs to do it too, and here is mine.

Now my next challenge is to figure out how to merge each of these areas, and to follow my progress, here is the Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@robguilarr">link</a> or if you want in my Home Page will be a button for <i>quick access</i>, or in another case, I will leave here the most recent posts of my Medium feed.
