Perhaps you have noticed in my about section that I have always been interested in documenting my work and write about topics of interest.

However, I will use this platform to write about <b>Data Science</b> and <b>Game Analytics</b> plus other interesting topics.

Just to be in context, I'll use Medium as side blog for Data Analytics related topics, so on this Website, I will post my projects.

Now my next challenge is to figure out how to merge each of these areas, and to follow my progress, here is the Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@robguilarr">hyperlink</a> and some external links from Twitter.
