### Summary:

- This academic article was developed through my postgraduate course, <i>DAT-03 Data Analysis in Big Data Environments</i>, which presents a business case in which a company is interested in combining and migrating relational databases in <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> and <b>Oracle DB</b>. Given the need to feed them with an NLP system output of social networks such as Instagram, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger.

- Initially, the vulnerabilities that the company has when managing its data in a Local Storage are shown, where it is compared with the advantages of implementing a <b>Cloud Service</b>. This service is compared with others such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Cloud Services, showing why this solution is the one that best suits the business case.

- An architecture diagram was designed, covering the required APIs to the ingestion, storage, processing, and loading of the data in BI tools to ease access to the end-user.

- Finally, financial aspects are covered in terms of operating costs for the proposed solution.
