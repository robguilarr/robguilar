As not many would expect, today I decided to start a new journey in <b>Medium</b>.

Perhaps you have noticed in my about section that I have always been an enthusiast of the gaming industry.

Just to put you in context I will take this as a side hobby, so at the beginning, I suggest to don't expect me to be a highly active user in the early days.

Thus for this moment, my main focus is to land a Data Analyst Job, so I will be preparing some posts on this page to let you know about my projects.

If you have a little bit of time, at Medium I released a new section named <i>"Gamers Lunch Box - Weekly Rewind"</i>, in which I will be talking about the loudest news about the Gaming Industry and sometimes about releases by Episodes.

Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@robguilarr">link</a> or if you want in my Home Page will be a button for quick access.
