    <description><![CDATA[As not many would expect, today I decided to start a new journey in Medium.
Perhaps you have noticed in my about section that I have always been an enthusiast of the gaming industry.
Just to put you in context I will take this as a side hobby, so at the beginning, I suggest to don&rsquo;t expect me to be a highly active user in the early days.
Thus for this moment, my main focus is to land a Data Analyst Job, so I will be preparing some posts on this page to let you know about my projects.]]></description>
