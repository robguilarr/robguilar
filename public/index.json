Perhaps you have noticed in my about section that I have always been interested in documenting my work and write about it, or as Austin Kleon would have said, this is a ‚ÄúDaily Dispatch‚Äù where I will show pieces of work, or at least i will try to ü§î However, I will use this platform to keep track of the progress of my recent projects in Data Science and some Analytical stuff, in a not exactly final-product way, but like a notebook. Just to put you in context, I‚Äôll use Medium as side documentation for Data Science Projects, so on this Website, I will post the project until it reaches the final stage. Thus for this moment, my main focus is to show my work and share results. Furthermore, if I have enough time I will write some other posts about other kinds of topics, like Books, Productive Working techniques, and some about Entertainment or personal interests like Video Games. Because I think that more important than just focusing on one niche, it‚Äôs important to have your essence of what you are deeply interested in. As one of my favorite writers David Perell mentions on his course ‚ÄúWrite of Passage‚Äù, as we want to show our work we need to define our Personal Monopoly, that skills and areas that are so specific that we can use together to leave our footprint (quick overview here at minute 45), although my main focus is not being a writer, an aspiring Data Scientist needs to do it too, and here is mine.

Nowadays this market is no longer considered a simple hobby for kids, it has become a constantly growing giant which attracts more and more customers as it takes advantage of the growth of streaming platforms.

However, as a way of clarification, if you are a member of the culture, it‚Äôs important to mention that due to limitations of the scope of data available for analysis, Tomohiro Nishikado‚Äôs masterpiece, released as Space Invaders, will not be part of the analysis; and in case you‚Äôre not a member don‚Äôt worry this is for you as well. From an optimistic point of view, we will analyze quite important historical data, because is difficult to even think about getting the 70s data like Pong; and another advantage is that we can start our journey from the market revolution in the early 80s.

Also, the average sales value is higher in North America despite the fact that the average sale of the titles is around 263,000 units, but its variation is quite high, so it should be compared more exhaustively. From a historical point of view, it makes sense, that knowing that the focus of sales is North America, cause even during the 60s the head of Nintendo of America, Minoru Arakawa, decided to expand their operations in the United States starting from the world of the arcade, so we can have the hypothesis to see this as a place of opportunities for this market.

Before highlighting the Japanese originality, it is necessary to know after successes of role-playing games such as Ultima VIII: Pagan (PC), this genre had a slow development, since the CD-ROMs generated great graphic expectations for the developers, by the way prolonging the releases, and for sure this caused a lack of interest from the community, and began to move towards action games or first person shooter such as Golden Eye (1997). However, success stories continued to appear in this genre such as Diablo (1996), developed by Blizzard Entertainment. # Dataframe for Genre lineplot df90G = df_long[(df_long[\"Year_of_Release\"] \u003e 1989) \u0026 (df_long[\"Year_of_Release\"] \u003c 2000) \u0026 ((df_long[\"Genre\"] == \"Role-Playing\") | (df_long[\"Genre\"] == \"Action\") | (df_long[\"Genre\"] == \"Platform\") | (df_long[\"Genre\"] == \"Fighting\") )] \\ .groupby([\"Genre\", \"Year_ts\"]).sum(\"Sales\").reset_index() # Plot an animated lineplot linegen = px.line(df90G, x=\"Year_ts\", y=\"Sales\", color=\"Genre\", title = \"Millions of units sold during 90s by Genre \", labels={\"Sales\": \"Millions of Units Sold\", \"Year_ts\":\"Years\"}) # To plot markers for i in np.arange(0,4): linegen.data[i].update(mode='markers+lines') # Line Layout layoutgen = {\"font\": {\"size\": fontimg, \"color\": colorfont, \"family\": \"segoe ui light\"}, \"title\":{'y':0.935, 'x':0.4, \"yref\":\"container\", 'xanchor': 'center', 'yanchor': 'top', \"font.family\":\"bahnschrift light\", \"font.color\":\"#202020\", \"font.size\":fontimg+5, \"pad.b\":15, # to avoid overlap with graph \"pad.l\":1}, \"showlegend\": True, \"legend\":{\"font.size\": fontimg, \"bordercolor\": \"#F70000\", \"itemclick\":\"toggleothers\", \"itemwidth\": 30, \"itemdoubleclick\":False, \"title.side\": \"top\", \"title.font.color\": \"#202020\", \"title.font.size\": fontimg+2, \"x\":1.05}, # distance with the plot default to 1.02 \"margin\":{\"b\": 65, \"l\": 65, \"r\": 65, \"t\": 80, \"pad\": 0}, \"autosize\":True, \"width\": widthimg, \"height\": heightimg, \"separators\": \". \", \"paper_bgcolor\": \"#fff\", \"plot_bgcolor\": \"#fff\", \"autotypenumbers\": \"convert types\", \"colorway\": [\"#996E3F\", \"#E05040\", \"#7B82C1\", \"#A1C790\"], \"modebar\":{\"add\":[\"togglespikelines\"], #\"drawline\",\"eraseshape\" \"orientation\":\"v\", \"remove\":[\"zoomin\",\"zoomout\",\"zoom\",\"lasso\",\"select\"], \"activecolor\":\"#171717\"}, \"hoverdistance\":50, #Distance between cursor and hover announce \"hovermode\":\"x unified\", \"hoverlabel\":{\"align\":\"left\", \"bordercolor\":\"#fff\", \"bgcolor\":\"#3D5165\", \"font.color\":\"#FFFFFF\", \"font.family\":\"segoe ui light\", \"font.size\":fontimg}, \"grid\":{\"pattern\":\"coupled\", \"roworder\":\"bottom to top\", \"xgap\":0.5, \"ygap\":0.5, \"xside\":\"bottom\"}, \"newshape\":{\"line.color\":\"#3D5165\", \"line.width\":1.5, \"opacity\":0.7}, \"activeshape.opacity\":0.7, \"xaxis\": {\"gridcolor\":\"#fff\", \"spikecolor\":\"#DEDEDE\", # Horizontal line hovered \"spikethickness\":1.5, \"title\":\"Years\", \"showspikes\": False, \"anchor\":\"free\", \"position\":0.02, \"showgrid\":False, \"tickcolor\":\"#FD0000\", \"ticklabelposition\": \"outside\", \"title.standoff\": 10, #Distance between axis title and axis labels \"automargin\": True}, \"yaxis\": {\"gridcolor\":\"#EDEDED\", \"title\":\"Millions of units\", \"spikecolor\":\"#DEDEDE\", # Horizontal line hovered \"spikethickness\":1.5, \"showspikes\": False, \"ticklabelposition\": \"outside\", \"tickprefix\": \"\", #Label prefix \"ticksuffix\": \"M\", \"title.standoff\": 10, #Distance between axis title and axis labels \"zeroline\": True, \"zerolinecolor\": \"#3D5165\", \"zerolinewidth\": 1.5, \"automargin\": True}, \"annotations\":[{\"text\":author, \"align\": \"right\", \"visible\":True, \"xref\":\"paper\", \"yref\":\"paper\", \"x\":1, \"y\":-0.11, \"showarrow\":False, \"font.size\":fontimg-1}]} # Update layout linegen.update_layout(layoutgen) linegen.show() Among all genres, the growth of RPG","date":"2021-09-01","objectID":"/posts/evga/:2:3","tags":["Data Storytelling","Python","Jupyther Notebook"],"title":"Video Games History plugged by Data","uri":"/posts/evga/"},{"categories":["Data Storytelling"],"content":"A new Japanese Ruler takes the throne 1994 - Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation is born\rRPGs not only boosted Nintendo, but multiplatform IPs like Final Fantasy VII gave companies such as Sony Computer Entertainment a boost during the introduction of their new 32-bit console and at the same time to publicize the JRPGs within the western market.
