#### :(far fa-compass fa-fw): About my career

<div>

A few years ago I started studying Industrial Engineering, meanwhile, as a hobby, I started learning how to develop mobile games in Unity, because video games have always been one of my favorite hobbies. After a year, I started to lose interest in development. Soon after, a friend told me about Data Science, but at first I wasn't interested.

However, one of my favorite subjects has always been statistics and probability, and I discovered that some people in the Software Entertainment industry were dedicated to retaining and acquiring users, and analyzing live metrics to improve UX and benefit the business itself. And most of those people have backgrounds associated with Analytics careers like Data Science, which is why I started to get motivated to pursue this path.

#### :(fas fa-hand-holding-medical fa-fw): What can I offer

I'm not an expert, but a curious mind. As one of my favorite authors Austin Kleon mentions, _*"You don't have to be a genius .... Sometimes amateurs have more to teach us than experts"*_,  they are always willing to learn keeping the contraints out of mind. For this reason, I want to show my work, eager to get feedback from people or groups who share the same interests as me.

I'm a Data Analyst with Engineering skills and a self-learning attitude. With experience in consulting, consumer goods, and virtualization technology industries. Who as an add-on has great enthusiasm for the Software Entertainment industry, in how data analytics can improve it as a business, using pre-development analytics, live metrics, and acquisition/retention analysis; for indie markets and big publishers.

#### :(fas fa-hiking fa-fw): Personal life & Hobbies

I'm a person who love to read to issues related to video games industry, especially in companies such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Xbox Studios, among others; also, in matters of marketing and applicability of Data Analysis in development, design, research and postproduction, that's why two of my main appeals are **Game Data Science** and **Game  Development**.

Without going too deep, I'm fascinated in following news from high-tech companies, about new product releases, and market movements, especially from Google and Microsoft.

I also like to read books about Business, Productivity, Personal Growth, Video Games and Game Analytics. Referring to authors such as Tom Rath, Austin Kleon, James Clear, David Goggins, Anders Drachen and Jason Schreier.

Among other personal hobbies I like playing video games and practicing outdoor sports like trail running.
