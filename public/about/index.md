#### :(far fa-user fa-fw): About my career

<div>

A few years ago I started studying Industrial Engineering, meanwhile, as a hobby, I started learning how to develop mobile games with Unity, because video games have always been one of my favorite hobbies.

After a year I started to lose interest in development and continued with my career. Shortly after, a friend told me about Data Science which I was a bit skeptical about at first, since I didn't have a clear idea of what it really was. However, one of my favorite subjects was always statistics and probability, so I saw an opportunity to find a new career path.

Later I started to learn to use Python, which was made easier for me thanks to my basic OOP knowledge in C# learned in Unity, then I started to learn on my own.

#### :(far fa-compass fa-fw): Interests

As one of my favorite authors Austin Kleon mentions, _*"You don't have to be a genius .... Sometimes amateurs have more to teach us than experts"*_, their mindset is different, and they are always willing to learn without looking at limitations. For this reason, I want to show my work, eager to get feedback from people or groups who share the same interests as me.

So do you think we share the same interests or at least similar? Regardless of your area, feel free to follow me on Social Media or contact me at one of the links below.

#### :(fas fa-hiking fa-fw): Personal life & Hobbies

I'm a person who love to read to issues related to video games industry, especially in companies such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Xbox Studios, among others; also, in matters of marketing and applicability of Data Analysis in development, design, research and postproduction, that's why one of my main appeals is **Game Data Science** and **AR**.

Without going too deep, I'm fascinated in following news from high-tech companies, about new product releases, and market movements, especially from Google and Microsoft.

I also like to read books about Business, Productivity, Personal Growth, Video Games and Game Analytics. Referring to authors such as Tom Rath, Austin Kleon, James Clear, David Goggins, Anders Drachen and Jason Schreier.

Among other personal hobbies I like playing video games and practicing outdoor sports like trail running.
