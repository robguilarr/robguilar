#### :(far fa-compass fa-fw): About my career

<div>

A few years ago, I started studying Industrial Engineering, at the same time, as a hobby, I started learning how to develop mobile games in Unity. Since video games have always been one of my favorite hobbies, I enjoyed learning how to make them and still. Unfortunately, after a year and a half, I put it aside.

Shortly after, a friend told me about Data Science — but at first, it didn't interest me because I didn't have a precise idea of ​​what it was about.

However, one of my favorite topics has always been statistics and probability — and then discovered that some people in the Software Entertainment industry are dedicated to retaining and acquiring users via analytics and data mining techniques to improve the UX and make games sustainable. And most of those people had backgrounds associated with Analytics careers like Data Science — which is why I started to get inspired to follow this path.

#### :(fas fa-hand-holding-medical fa-fw): What can I offer

I'm not an expert, but a creative and curious mind. As one of my favorite authors, Austin Kleon says, "You don't have to be a genius .... Sometimes amateurs have more to teach us than experts", they are always willing to learn, holding the constraints out of mind. For this reason, I like to show my work, eager to get feedback from people or groups who share the same interests as me, and help them however I can.

I'm a Data Analyst with Engineering skills and a self-learning attitude. With experience in consulting, consumer goods, and virtualization technology industries. Who as an add-on has great enthusiasm for the Software Entertainment industry, in how data analytics can improve it as a business, using pre-development analytics, live metrics, and acquisition/retention analysis; for indie markets and big publishers.

Before I started working as a data analyst, I started out as a self-taught Unity programmer. This describes a very important characteristic of mine, and it is the motivation to continuously learn on my own, in the sense of wanting to explore the unknown and accept new challenges. I like to propose **creative perspectives** to improve in each area of work, especially when it comes to getting the most out of one of today's most valuable resources, data.

Without going too deep, I'm fascinated in following news from high-tech companies, about new product releases, and market movements, especially from Google and Microsoft. I also like to read books about Business, Productivity, Personal Growth, Video Games and Game Analytics. Referring to authors such as Tom Rath, Austin Kleon, James Clear, David Goggins, Anders Drachen and Jason Schreier.
