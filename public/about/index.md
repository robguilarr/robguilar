#### :(far fa-user fa-fw): Hi, I’m Roberto Aguilar

I'm a Data Analyst, Senior Industrial Engineering Student and content developer at this website.

A few years ago the question arose of what approach I wanted to give to my career. I was always interested in statistics, research writing and in a short time of my life I got involved in OOP. Then I met people who were dedicated to extracting information and developing complex tools from Big Data, that's where I discovered the world of Data Science and how it is applied in our day to day.

Before starting the Data Analyst program, I started as a self-taught programmer. This describes a very important attribute of me, and it is the motivation to self-learn and never settle, also my researcher perspective has helped me to take new challenges and looking for productive ways to improve every day, that is why I decided to advance a Postgraduate Program as a Data Analyst.

#### :(far fa-compass fa-fw): Interests

As one of my favorite authors Austin Kleon mentions, _*"You don't have to be a genius .... Sometimes amateurs have more to teach us than experts"*_, their mindset is different, and they are always willing to learn without looking at limitations. For this reason, I want to show my work, eager to get feedback from people or groups who share the same interests as me.

So do you think we share the same interests or at least similar? Regardless of your area feel free to follow me on Medium or contact me at one of the links below, let's build a <i>Scenius</i>.

#### :(fas fa-hiking fa-fw): Personal life & Hobbies

I am a person attentive to issues related to the entertainment and video games industry, in matters of marketing and applicability of Data Analysis in RPGs, as well as I like to read infographic articles about this type of companies such as Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, among others.

Without going too deep, I'm fascinated in following news from high-tech companies, about new launches, and market movements, especially at Google and Microsoft.

I also like to read books about productivity and personal growth, in order to find methodologies to improve my work and the best way to achieve it, referring to authors such as Tom Rath, Austin Kleon, David Perell, James Clear and Dale Carnegie.

Among other personal hobbies I like playing video games and practicing outdoor sports like trailrunning.
