    <description><![CDATA[<p>The industry of video games revenues is reaching the $173.7 billion in value, with around 2.5 billion users enjoying them worldwide, with a forecasted value of $314.40 billion by 2026 according to Mordor Intelligence.</p>

Just to put you in context I will take this as a side hobby, so at the beginning, I suggest to don&rsquo;t expect me to be a highly active user in the early days.
Thus for this moment, my main focus is to land a Data Analyst Job, so I will be preparing some posts on this page to let you know about my projects.]]></description>
